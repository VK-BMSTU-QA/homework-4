For configuring testing environment run:
```bash
make test CHROME_VERSION=101
```

You can use the variable `CHROME_VERSION` to specify Google Chrome version you have
or trust the installation script. Possible versions are `99`, `100`, `101`, `102`
By default the installation script defines the version of google chrome on your mac.
